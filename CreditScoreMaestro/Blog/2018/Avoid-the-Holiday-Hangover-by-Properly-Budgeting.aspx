            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis the season to be jolly. Assuredly, most of us are thinking about the gift(s) we will get for each of our loved ones.
			As we do so, we should be calculating to assure we do not suffer a financial hangover once the holidays are over. It is easy to fall off
			of our budget this time of year. We see the great sales that retailers offer, and we make a purchase. If you are doing so with accumulated
			savings, you are in decent shape. The use of a credit card, on the other hand, can cause the savings from the sale to evaporate.
        </p>
	    <p class="card-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This occurs if you end up paying interest on that purchase. Interest will be charged if you are carrying a balance on that
			credit card or do not pay the bill in full when it arrives. So, while you may have gained a savings through the sale's price, financing charges
			result in a profit for your creditor and may cause you to pay more than the actual presale price if it takes months to pay that purchase off.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much have you budgeted for the Holiday Season? How long will it take you to pay it off if you charged it all? 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, how much interest will you pay on the balance? Download our <a href="https://creditscoremaestro.com">FREE Financial Health Calculator</a> to determine the answer
			to the last two questions. Our calculator will help you create a budget, determine the full cost of credit, and create plans to pay off debt. It is
			an essential tool to assist you in maintaining control of your finances and assuring that you spend only what you intend and can afford. 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit hangovers and buyer's remorse make for a depressing start to the New Year. We at Credit Score Maestro want you jolly
			all year long, and having your finances in order while building your credit score to enjoy lower interest rates help make that a reality.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of a great gift, give Winning the Credit Score Game to your loved ones who need some financial guidance, and gift
			yourself with a copy. It is a gift that will keep giving once you apply its plans to build a 760+ credit score. We wish you a Happy Holiday
			season and a prosperous New Year. Peace be with you.
