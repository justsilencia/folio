            </li>
            <li class="answer">

                Almost every consumer has inaccurate or incomplete information on their reports.
                In such cases, they must engage in credit repair through the dispute process 
                to have it removed, or they need to learn and practice the basic precepts and 
                fundamentals of the credit score game.

            <li class="question">
                Q. How do I build positive credit?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. Practice the Disciplined Credit Philosophy. 
                The key factor in this is establishing and following a budget.

                Q. Do negative items on my credit report impact my credit score?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. It depends on how old the item is. A negative item will cause an 
                immediate drop in your credit score. As it becomes older and 
                positive items appear on your report, the negatives have an 
                increasingly less affect upon your score.
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. How long do negative items stay on my credit report?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides for a bankruptcy to remain for 10 years; 
                collection accounts  and charged-off debt remain for 7 1/2 years; all other adverse 
                items must be removed after 7 years.  
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. Can I remove inaccurate or incomplete negative items from my credit report myself?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. <b>Yes.</b> There are 'credit repair specialists' who make a living off of providing
                credit-repair services.They, however, perform a service that you should complete
                yourself. Only you, by law, can send a dispute to a lender, and you know your 
                situation best. Plus, doing it yourself is cheaper when you consider the minimal 
                time you spend in DIY credit repair against how many hours you must work to pay
                someone a fee for that service.
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. How do I build a credit score?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. Anytime you do business with a company that reports to the credit bureaus,
                you are building a credit score.
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. Is credit good or bad?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. The answer to this question lies in whether it is used according to the Disciplined
                Credit Philosophy or whether it is used without a plan. Those who use credit in an 
                undisciplined manner eventually find themselves in a financial squeeze and heading to 
                collections or bankruptcy.  On the other hand, disciplined players have the buying 
                power to get themselves out of squeezes, and they enjoy the lowest interest rates.
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. How much credit do I need?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. This depends upon how you use credit. To achieve a top tier credit score, you need 
                enough to assure you owe less than 10% of the credit limit on every credit card when 
                your credit score is pulled.
            </li>
            <li class="question">

            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. <b>Yes.</b> You can make them authorized users on your credit cards.

            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. <b>Yes.</b> However, statutes of limitations apply that limit how long a lender 
                can take you to court to force payment. 
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. How long do positive items remain on my credit report?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. No law regulates this, but as long as an account is active, it will stay on your 
                report. Inactive accounts are removed under the credit bureaus' 10 year rule from 
                the last activity.

            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. There are two ways. You can wait for the Fair Credit Reporting Act statute of 
                limitations to expire, or you can engage in credit repair and file a dispute letter 
                with the credit bureau and/or creditor.
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. What are pre-paid credit cards?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. There is no such thing as a pre-paid credit card. A credit card is ether secured 
                or unsecured; both extend  credit and report payments or non-payments to the credit 
                bureaus. These so-called  pre-paid credit cards are not credit cards at all; they are 
                debit cards. Credit card companies use the money you pre-pay on the card to pay for 
                your purchases. There is no credit extended. Staying away from so-called pre-paid 
                credit cards, as they do nothing to build your credit.

            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. <b>No.</b> It will reduce your balance, which will lower the utilization rate 
                on the account. This will help increase your credit score. 
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Q. What is a pre-paid credit card?
            </li>
            <li class="answer">
                A. There is no such thing. Credit cards fall into two classes: secured and unsecured. 
                A pre-paid card is actually a debit card that is not reported to the credit bureaus.
            </li>

                factor.
